How to assign points to clusters if I have information only about a limited number of NNs?

The first problem arises when all the points in the neighborhood of a point are filtered
The second problem is that the center points won't will be out of the neighborhood of many points, so when I start assigning I have to loop many times on all the points not yet assigned (it shouldn't be a problem, though, because it is anyway better than compute all the distances.)


Can a point be at the border between three clusters?
